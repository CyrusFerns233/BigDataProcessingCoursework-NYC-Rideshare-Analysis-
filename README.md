# NYC Rideshare Data Analysis Using PySpark

This project applies PySpark to perform detailed data analysis on New York City rideshare data, combining it with taxi zone information to offer insights into urban transportation dynamics.

## Project Description

This analysis enhances NYC rideshare data by merging it with comprehensive taxi zone information, allowing for advanced insights into pickup and dropoff patterns. It demonstrates the power of PySpark in processing and analyzing large datasets efficiently.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Merges rideshare and taxi zone data to provide enriched information for each trip.
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data integrity and accuracy through thorough schema checks post-merging.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes PySpark's capabilities to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Insights

The project addresses critical data challenges such as duplication and loss, providing reliable insights into:
- Enhanced service demand understanding.
- Operational improvement opportunities for rideshare services.

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: For robust data processing and analysis.
- **Amazon S3**: For data storage and management.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- Apache Spark
- Python 3.x
- Hadoop (optional, for HDFS support)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Install Apache Spark**:

   ```bash
   # Example for Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install -y apache-spark

2. **Set up your Python environment**:

    ```bash

    # It's recommended to use virtual environments
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate

3. **Install required Python packages**:

    ```bash

    pip install pyspark

4. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyc-rideshare-analysis.git
    cd nyc-rideshare-analysis

**Usage**

Describe how to use your project for analyzing the data:

    ```python

    # Sample usage code
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("NYC Rideshare Analysis").getOrCreate()
    df = spark.read.csv('path_to_data.csv', header=True)
    # Your data processing commands here
