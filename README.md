NYC Rideshare Data Analysis Using PySpark

This repository contains the NYC Rideshare Analysis project, which utilizes PySpark to handle and analyze large datasets effectively. The focus is on enriching rideshare data with detailed taxi zone information to provide precise insights into pickup and dropoff dynamics across New York City.
Project Overview

The project demonstrates the capability of PySpark to merge and transform large-scale data from multiple sources. Through this analysis, we aim to enhance the context of rideshare trips by integrating them with exhaustive taxi zone details, thereby aiding in more accurate data-driven decision-making.
Features

    Data Merging: Combines rideshare data with taxi zone information to create a comprehensive dataset that includes enriched details for every trip.
    Schema Validation: Ensures the integrity and completeness of the data by meticulously validating the schemas post-merging, which helps in maintaining data accuracy.
    Performance Optimization: Implements efficient data handling and processing techniques to manage large volumes of data without compromising on performance.

Insights Generated

The project successfully overcomes challenges like data duplication and loss, using strategic data integration and analysis methods. Key insights include:

    Improved understanding of service demand based on precise location data.
    Identification of potential areas for operational enhancement within the rideshare services.

Technologies Used

    PySpark: For data processing and analysis.
    AWS S3: Used for storing and retrieving the datasets.

Usage

This project serves as an excellent reference for those interested in understanding how to process and analyze large datasets using PySpark and could be particularly useful for data scientists and analysts working in urban transportation planning or rideshare service optimization.
